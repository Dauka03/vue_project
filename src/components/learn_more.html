                It is often treated as an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by <b>Sir Thomas More</b> and figures as the title of his best known work, published in 1516, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty. The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality contrary of being an instance of simple opposition, as many utopian elements and components are found in dystopias as well, and vice versa.

                Dystopias are often characterized by rampant fear or distress, tyrannical governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Despite certain overlaps, dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many fictional works and artistic representations, particularly in stories set in the future. The best known by far is <b>George Orwell's</b> <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> (1948). Other famous examples are <b>Aldous Huxley's</b> <i>Brave New World</i> (1932), and <b>Ray Bradbury's</b> <i>Fahrenheit 451 </i>(1953). Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, totalitarian states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, often make a criticism about a current trend, societal norm, or political system.
